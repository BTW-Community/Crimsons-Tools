## Information

### Stone Trowel

The Stone Trowel is meant to smooth the early-game base building gameplay, especially where deep dirt may be hard to find.
It allow you to dig out dirt and grass without converting adjacent dirt into "loose dirt" -- in short, allowing you to
tunnel without causing cave-ins. The trowel has very low durability and slow use speed. Along with the cost of string,
this maintains the Iron Shovel as a significant upgrade.
